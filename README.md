# Publitas Frontend Code Challenge

Image slider that lets you drag to change images in React, rendered in a single canvas element

### Browser Compatibility

The image slider is designed to work on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

Supported Browsers

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Built Release

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and nws installed. If not, you can install nws globally using:

```bash
npm install -g nws
```

### Option 1: Use the Provided Build

If you prefer a ready-made solution:

- Navigate to the `build` directory:

```bash
cd build
```

- Start the static file server using nws:

```bash
nws
```

- Open your preferred browser and visit the provided URL, typically http://localhost:3030

Now the image slider will be running from the built release.

### Option 2: Build the Project Yourself

If you want to build the project from scratch:

- Run the command:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Follow the steps from Option 1

#### Notes

- Decided to use the images provided in the description but tested it with different set of images as well and works as expected
